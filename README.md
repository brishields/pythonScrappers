# pythonScrappers
Collection of python scapers from a project involving capturing various natal chart data from a web source and exporting it into files. I used Selenium to automate testing, Swiss Ephemeris for astrological calculations, and Matplotlib Pyplot for data visualization.

Future Plans
I hope to use the experience and skills I have gained to build another web application using my own logic, code and calculations to automatically generate comprehensive natal charts and reports. Having studied astrology since a small child, I love any opportunity to bridge my metaphysical interests with modern techology. Natal chart analysis a process that takes days to weeks of work to do by hand. I hope to streamline that process using a combination of technology to calculate, analyze, and display natal chart information in an organized and digestible way.
